===== FIRESTORE RULES UPDATE FOR BUG REPORTING =====

Add this rule to your Firestore rules to allow bug report submissions:

```javascript
// Debug and Bug Reports
match /artifacts/{appId}/debug/bug-reports/{reportId} {
  // Anyone authenticated can submit bug reports
  allow create: if request.auth != null;

  // Only admins can read bug reports
  allow read: if request.auth != null && isAdmin(appId);

  // Only admins can delete bug reports
  allow delete: if request.auth != null && isAdmin(appId);
}
```

Add this INSIDE the existing `match /artifacts/{appId}` block, alongside the other rules.
